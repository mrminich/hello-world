Hi Humans from another world!

Minich here, I like Java and Python.
I've travled all across the universe in order to find the perfect taco.
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.
The best tacos are from the sun though because of how hot they are.
Your world has no point of living unless you have the best tacos in the world.
